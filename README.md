Hi there! Welcome to my profile. I'm AndrÃ©s GonzÃ¡lez, a Front End Developer passionate about creating valuable interfaces. My expertise lies in developing and maintaining Javascript-React-based applications, managing project timelines, and ensuring code quality using various tools and strategies in a remote environment.

I've been committed to enhancing usability and functionality throughout my career by creating new UI components and features with React, Typescript, and the Material-UI (MUI) library. I've also contributed to team best practices by participating actively in code reviews, sharing my knowledge, and suggesting improvements to streamline processes.

I'm an assertive communicator and a team player, experienced in working in agile development environments using Scrum and SAFe methodologies. Being fluent in Spanish and English enables me to communicate effectively with clients and colleagues from diverse backgrounds. Currently, I'm working as a Software Developer at Anthology Inc (Blackboard), where I've contributed to meaningful projects for the past year and a half. However, I'm always open to new opportunities and challenges that allow me to continue growing as a developer and contribute to impactful projects. If you're interested in working together to create value for users, please contact me at andresgfranco0@gmail.com.
