### Thanks for being here ðŸ‘‹

I am AndrÃ©s, and I would not have been the person and professional I am today if I had not satisfied all my curiosities during my career. With ten years of experience, I have been a journalist, teacher, musician, counselor, translator, filmmaker, producer, voiceover professional, digital entrepreneur, UX researcher, and currently building myself as a software developer. What makes me have the ability to apply knowledge across situations and solve problems in different scenarios.

I am now looking to build high-impact digital solutions as a Software Developer in both Emerging Markets and Developed Economies, helping build bridges between the two.
